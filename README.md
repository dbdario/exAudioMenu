# +R External Audio Menu Mod (Windowed Only)
This is an external audio menu for +R (Windowed only). It allows players to adjust the volume for background music, voice, and sound effects any time, even during matches and training mode. It is mostly complete and should work properly but needs a few adjustments.

## How to Run
1. Start Plus R. Make sure it is in windowed mode and not in fullscreen.
2. Run exAudioMenu.exe while Plus R is open.
3. Press the '1' key (not the numpad key) to open the menu, and press 1 again to close the menu.

## Notable Glitches
- The program does not like it when the resolution of +R is adjusted while it is being run. The game won't crash but the menu will be contorted and stretched. Be sure to restart the program if you change your resolution.
- As noted earlier, this only works when the game is in windowed mode. This means it won't work when the game is in fullscreen.
